## How organizations protect themselves from security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.
The core concepts covered are:\
**Frameworks**: These provide structured guidance and policies for organizing security efforts and making informed decisions.\
**Controls**: These are specific measures or safeguards implemented to protect assets. An example given is security keys for two-factor authentication, which enhance confidentiality and integrity.\
**Ethics**: The course will also delve into ethical considerations within the security field, including notable ethical concerns.  \
The **CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability)** is introduced as a crucial foundational concept.

## How security professionals use **security frameworks** and **security controls** to manage risk.

**Key Concepts:**

* **Security Analyst's Role:** Identify critical assets and risks, then implement frameworks and controls.
* **Security Frameworks:** Guidelines for building plans to mitigate risks and threats, providing a structured approach to a **security lifecycle** (evolving policies/standards for risk management, compliance). Their purpose includes protecting PII and financial information, identifying weaknesses, managing risk, and aligning with business goals.
    * **Four Core Components:**
        1.  Identify and document security goals (e.g., GDPR compliance).
        2.  Set guidelines to achieve goals (e.g., data handling policies).
        3.  Implement strong security processes (e.g., procedures for user data requests).
        4.  Monitor and communicate results (e.g., report security issues).
* **Security Controls:** Safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks (e.g., privacy training for employees). They are vital for maintaining low risk levels within an organization.

## The use of **security frameworks** and **security controls** to manage and mitigate risks in an organization.

* **Initial Steps for a Security Analyst:** Identify critical assets and risks, then implement frameworks and controls.
* **Security Frameworks:**
    * **Definition:** Guidelines for creating plans to reduce data and privacy risks, providing a structured **security lifecycle** (evolving policies for risk management, guidelines, and regulatory compliance).
    * **Purpose:** Protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and financial data, identify weaknesses, manage risks, and align with business goals (e.g., adhering to GDPR).
    * **Four Core Components:**
        1.  Identify and document security goals.
        2.  Set guidelines to achieve goals.
        3.  Implement strong security processes.
        4.  Monitor and communicate results.
* **Security Controls:**
    * **Definition:** Specific safeguards designed to reduce particular security risks (e.g., mandating privacy training for employees).
    * **Relationship to Frameworks:** Controls are the practical measures used to implement the strategic plans outlined by frameworks.

Both frameworks and controls are essential for effective risk management, ensuring a strong security posture, and protecting an organization's data and people.

## Specific security frameworks and controls. 

The most important concepts are:

* **CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability):** A foundational model for risk consideration in security systems and policies.
    * **Confidentiality:** Only authorized users can access specific assets or data (e.g., strict access controls).
    * **Integrity:** Data is correct, authentic, and reliable (e.g., using encryption to prevent tampering).
    * **Availability:** Data is accessible to authorized users.
* **Asset:** An item with value to an organization, determined by its associated cost (e.g., an application storing sensitive data is more valuable than a public news website).
* **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF):** A voluntary U.S.-based framework providing standards, guidelines, and best practices for managing cybersecurity risk. Security teams use it as a baseline for risk management.
* **Threat Actors:** Individuals or entities who pose a risk to an organization's assets. Disgruntled employees are noted as particularly dangerous due to their access to sensitive information.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Security professionals use principles like availability (from the CIA triad) and organizational guidelines based on frameworks to reduce risks, such as limiting employee access to only necessary data.
* **Diverse Workforce:** A diverse security team is crucial for identifying attackers' intentions and mitigating malicious activity effectively.
